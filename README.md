# Sudoku-Java
This is a Java-based Sudoku game implementation. It provides a graphical user interface for playing Sudoku puzzles on your computer. The game features a Sudoku board that allows you to input numbers and solve the puzzle.

### Features:
- Interactive Sudoku board with a customizable grid size
- Mouse click functionality to select and navigate cells
- Arrow key navigation for moving across cells
- Ability to input numbers in editable cells
- Sudoku board validation to check for duplicate numbers in rows, columns, and blocks

The project is implemented using Java and Swing for the graphical user interface.
It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, separating the game logic from the user interface.
